I am a Software Engineer focused on back-end web services and CLIs. I get paid to develop and improve .NET applications and in my free time I enjoy working with Rust. I've published seven apps to the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/john-harrington/id1603002572) and two on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=John+Harrington). I've also published to the Microsoft Store, Mac App Store, and F-Droid. 

Developing mobile and desktop apps has provided me with an appreciation for creating reliable and secure back-end web services. I'm currently focused on learning Rust very well. I have published three crates on [crates.io](https://crates.io/users/harr1424).
